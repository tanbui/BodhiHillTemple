## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Gold (#FFD700) to reflect the sacred and precious nature of Buddhist teachings and traditions.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC), a very desaturated color derived from gold, providing a soft, neutral backdrop that complements the primary color.
- Accent color: A muted orange (#D2691E) is an analogous color to gold that symbolizes energy and warmth while maintaining a calm visual balance.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a serif font known for its elegance, to give a high-end feel to headlines and titles.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a modern humanist sans-serif paired with Playfair, ensures readability and a contemporary touch for longer texts. 
- Use simple, clean icons that represent key elements of Buddhism and temple life. For example, a lotus icon, dharma wheel icon, or buddha image.
- Incorporate gentle, subtle animations like smooth transitions and fades to enhance user experience without distraction.
